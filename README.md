Latest Gorilla Tag Unity Project (Pulled Straight From Version Control)

This is the latest Gorilla Tag Unity Project with working servers, steam auth and visuals. This will always be updated.

There are always two versions of the Projects,
- Steam
- Oculus

- The Steam version has Steam Auth which can be built into a build for PC then dragged into your Gorilla Tag Steam directoryto auth with Steam, or can be logged in with a Steam Ticket in the Unity Editor,
- The Oculus version has Oculus Auth which can be built into a PC build then dragged into your Oculus PC version to Auth, it can be built for Quest but will NOT auth due to keystore issues, if somebody gets hold of the keystore please email at noxgamesmeta@gmail.com

THIS IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH GORILLA TAG OR ANOTHER AXIOM INC, I AM NOT RESPONSABLE FOR ANY LEGAL TROUBLE THIS GETS YOU INTO. IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF ANOTHER AXIOM LEGAL TEAM AND WISH FOR THIS TO GET TAKEN DOWN PLEASE EMAIL ME AT noxgamesmeta@gmail.com .
